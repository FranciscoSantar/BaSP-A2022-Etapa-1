***THIS IS AN EDUCATION PROJECT***

This project is about *Trackgenix*

Trackgenix is an web application for the company GigaTech. This app speeds up the record of the hours worked for each employee of the company, the project that is working in and his team work.

The model of this page was designed in Figma, you can find it [here](https://www.figma.com/file/nNTIPd7HwRNBoqBnlLO4Vl/UI-kit-RR-(BaSP)-B?node-id=1275%3A5438)

## Week 01
I made the HTML document of the Trackgenix's landing page to define the structure of it

## Week 02
In this week I made a sheet of style for the HTML of week 01. **This page isnÂ´t responsive** i.e. this page doesn't have any flexbox property on it, is made for a laptop screen only
